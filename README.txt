Feedback-Module
===============
This is the "sideblock" feedback (optional)

The activity is the main part an can run without the block. Here you can create, fill out or analyse the surveys.
The sideblock is an optional part. It works as a bridge between different courses and
an central placed feedback-activity. So you can create one feedback on the main site of moodle and then publish
it in many courses.
